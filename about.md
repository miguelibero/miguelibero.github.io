![Me giving a talk on concurrency]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/aboutme.jpg)

My name is Miguel Ibero and I am a software developer from Barcelona, Spain.
I am currently working at [Social Point](http://www.socialpoint.es),
developing social games for smartphones. I'm interested in
concurrency and software architecture. I'm mostly busy with Unity3D
C# now and I like it, though my love will always be C++.

## [eventually](https://github.com/miguelibero/eventually)

A C++11 asyncronous library I built to teach myself some advanced C++
templates. It adds continuation support to `std::future` and has it's
own http client on top of libcurl.


## [gorn](https://github.com/miguelibero/gorn)

A C++11 layer on top of OpenGL that simplifies the more tedious tasks
of defining vertex attributes and also includes a asset loading system.
Works on iOS and Android. One day (ehem) it will become a complete
game engine! (not likely)

## [jniobject](https://github.com/miguelibero/jniobject)

A C++11 wrapper for the JNI library that simplifies calling java code
from C++ and the other way around. It will automatically create method
signatures and convert containers.
